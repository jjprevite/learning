# [ES6 Javascript: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/javascript-es6-tutorial)
I am starting this course on March 11th, 2018 to level up my ES6 skills.


### What is an 'iterator function'? 
It's a function that it is used when iterating over an array. For example,

```javascript
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];

colors.forEach(function(color){
  console.log(color);
});
```
^Here, the iterator function is passed as an argument to the .forEach array helper function.
