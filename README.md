# What I'm learning
The purpose of this repo is track everything I'm learning related to programming. I will write average 1 commit per day, which will be tracked via [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/jjprevite/code). This means, if I know I won't be able to study one day, I can study twice the day before and still be on track technically.

## 100 Days of Code - Round 3 - Thurs. Nove
In an effort to join the community and stay accountable, I am joining the [#100DaysOfCode](http://100daysofcode.com/index.html) movement and committing to: 
1. averaging 30 minutes of studying/coding every day
2. posting on Twitter every day I study/code

I am choosing this approach because of my current commitments. Some days, I will be able to study and other days I may not. This will be easier to stay on target and achieve my goal. 

### Learning Materials
Throughout these next 100 Days these are the projects I will be focusing on (these are in no particular order):
- [CS50](https://github.com/jjprevite/cs50) -an intro to computer science
- [Web-Bakers](https://github.com/Web-Bakers/web-bakers) -an open-source project I'm working on with two other friends
- Startup Idea -can't share much here because it's still in development but working on a tech-product-idea with a few business partners
- [Thinkful Curriculum](https://www.thinkful.com/) -an online career accelerator. They also host local meetups. I TA for the [Phoenix one](https://www.meetup.com/Thinkful-Phoenix/). 
- [freeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org) -I'm close to finishing the Front End Certificate so I hope I can within the 100 days.
