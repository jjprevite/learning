## Notes
#### December 23rd, 2017
- felt like a Javascript ninja today.
- one of the methods on my app.js wasn't working but I figure it out through debugging. It was because the first 'app' in the database didn't have all the properties because I change the schema after adding it to the db. This caused a lot of 'undefined' properties. I deleted this app and then added one that had all the properties and it worked! I'll have to create a better solution to handle the scenario where a user doesn't add in all properties. (#note-to-self)

#### December 22nd, 2017
- continued working through tutorial. Created a database on MLab. 
- found an error in the tutorial and submitted a PR.
- stopped at "Getting and posting to the database"

#### December 20th, 2017
- using the [repo](https://github.com/bryantheastronaut/mernCommentBox) from tutorial instead of Medium article.
