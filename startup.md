# Startup -  

## General Tasks I need to Complete

## Notes
### March 20th, 2018
- worked on ISH website. Added in contact component
- found a good tutorial on using the MailChimp API with React. 
- started creating ISH website design in Figma

### March 18th, 2018
- worked on ISH website.
- finished the footer today.
- still need to finish the form.
- need to spend some time fixing up the design.

### March 17th, 2018
- worked on ISH website again.
- added cards and added footer to bottom. 
- website still looks super bland. Needs a lot of style/design work.

#### March 11th, 2018
- made some good progress on ISH website.

#### March 9th, 2018
- tried figuring out a solution for the email submission form. No luck yet.

#### March 4th, 2018
- worked on ish website.
- added controlled components to form elements.
- need to figure out how to submit POST request for form data in background.

#### March 3rd, 2018
- worked on ish website. 
- created a MailChimp account then added form into website. Need to fix though because you can't edit right now.

#### February 26th, 2018
- currently working on the Contact component.
- figured out I should be able to use axios to submit form data to db.
- hoping to use ternary statement

#### January 4th, 2018
- worked on app, now displaying app names instead of author names
- can't update app name though, need to fix.

#### January 2nd, 2018
- worked on app, fixed delete request
- tried to fix Redirect, still not working.

#### January 1st, 2018
- made a lot of progress today! Successfully added React Router
- moved form to it's on page /form
- form is now successfully POSTing to database
- struggling with the redirect after form submission

#### December 31st, 2017
- worked on app. Spent about an hour or so learning how to use React Router. I was successful but the the form is now broken and making post requests to the database is not working correctly. Felt frustrated but will push through it tomorrow.

#### December 27th, 2017
- worked on updating the form to have all the fields needed for the apps.

#### December 23rd, 2017
- felt like a Javascript ninja today.
- one of the methods on my app.js wasn't working but I figure it out through debugging. It was because the first 'app' in the database didn't have all the properties because I change the schema after adding it to the db. This caused a lot of 'undefined' properties. I deleted this app and then added one that had all the properties and it worked! I'll have to create a better solution to handle the scenario where a user doesn't add in all properties. (#note-to-self)
