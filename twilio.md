## Notes
#### January 18th, 2018
- checked code for deleting a message, 'Time Tunnel' mission
- Jen and a teammate helped debug it and it looks like there's a bug in the verifier - woo for bug spotting!

#### January 14th, 2018
- completed the "Unlimited Powerrr: Copilot Scale" mission! :D
- completed two bonuses at the very end

#### January 12th, 2018
- still worked on 'Time Travel' mission. Wrote a function to get the most recent message, then another function to delete it, after another message is sent, and to wait 15 seconds. Doesn't pass - we'll see what I can do tomorrow.

#### January 8th, 2018
- finally figured out how to use the statusCallback parameter for the 'Message Delivered?' quest - big win! Now working on deleting a message.
- I swear I have everything set up correctly but it doesn't seem to be verifying my message deletion. Hmm..

#### January 6th, 2018
- made some progress on Twilio Quest. Still getting stuck with statusCallback but learning more.

#### January 2nd, 2018
- looked at code for 'Message Received?' mission. Still stuck.
- howver, completed this [tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/docs/guides/how-to-confirm-delivery-in-node-js) and learned how to use the statusCallback parameter. Now I just have to figure out how to use it in my other app.

#### December 31st, 2017
- continued working on 'Message Received?' mission. Didn't make much progress though.
- Finished first mission in the Lookup section.

#### December 26th, 2017
- completed the "Project: To-do Bot"
- I totally thought I couldn't finish today but I pushed through, figured it out and made it work how I wanted to. 250XP

#### December 22nd, 2017
- completed the "New app, who dis?" mission and reported bug to Twilio because it wasn't verifying even though my code was right.
- Twilio helped me via Twitter DMs, shoutout to Andrew!
